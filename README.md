# scanpy-scripts [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/scanpy-scripts/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/scanpy-scripts) 

A command-line interface for functions of the Scanpy suite, to facilitate flexible constrution of workflows, for example in Galaxy, Nextflow, Snakemake etc.

## Install

```bash
conda install scanpy-scripts
# or
pip3 install scanpy-scripts
```

## Test installation

There is an example script included:

```bash
scanpy-scripts-tests.bats
```

This requires the [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) testing framework to run. The script downloads [a well-known test 10X dataset]('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10x.files/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz) and executes all of the commands described below.

## Commands

Available commands are described below. Each has usage instructions available via --help, consult function documentation in scanpy for further details.
